# psi_decorations

This repository contains Python code for related to certain psi class products. It implements a sign-reversing involution on "mismatched decorations" used in calculating integrals of products of psi classes on multicolored moduli spaces of genus-zero curves.

- **involution.py** has the core definitions, including the `MismatchedDecoration` class and the sign-reversing involution on mismatched decorations.
- **basics.py** includes helper functions for working with integer partitions, compositions, set partitions, and multinomial assignments.
- **examples.py** contains worked examples and a test suite.

Feel free to use or modify these files for research, experimentation, or as a reference.
