# psi_decorations

This repository contains Python code for exploring combinatorial and algebraic structures related to psi class products. It uses set partitions, integer compositions, and sign-reversing involutions as its main mathematical tools.

- **involution.py** has the core definitions, including the `MismatchedDecoration` class and the sign-reversing involution on mismatched decorations. This file is the heart of the code, and is where the main mathematical ideas are implemented.
- **basics.py** includes helper functions for working with integer partitions, compositions, set partitions, and multinomial assignments. These are the building blocks used throughout the project.
- **examples.py** contains worked examples and a test suite. It demonstrates how to use the main code, and includes both concrete instances and functions for checking the properties of the involution.

Feel free to use or modify these files for research, experimentation, or as a reference for combinatorial algebraic Python code.
